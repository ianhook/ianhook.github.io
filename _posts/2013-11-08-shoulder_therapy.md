So my shoulder still hurts, but the pain is really more of an annoyance most of the time.  It's those
other times that count though.

The plan is simple.  Strengthening every other day:
{% include youtube.html src="KQRtiLpomHg" seconds="0" %}

Stretching every day:
{% include youtube.html src="ppToA1N0CgE" seconds="0" %}

And most importantly icing whenever it hurts.  Hopefully that will be less than before, but if it's not 
I'll cut strength then stretching to give it a rest.

My wrist got better, not as good as it was but better than my shoulder, so it's time to be more proactive 
about this!
