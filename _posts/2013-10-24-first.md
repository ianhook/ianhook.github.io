First!

---

I'm going to start with a pin. <br />

{% include pin.html img="son_doong.jpg" url="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/07/son-doong_n_3873341.html" title="World's Largest Cave, Son Doong" %}

Let's see if this works.  Jumping into new includes first thing doesn't seem like the best way to get comfortable but it does sound like a good plan considering my stated goals.  Once it looks half decent I'll go back and do css and stuff.

Apparently the shortcut for external links has some kinks that I don't understand yet. My first couple of attempts at using them failed so I wrote out the html.  It seems legit, but the posts that came with this theme had no problem doing them.  I'll have to look into this later.

Oh and apparently I have to do UTC timestamps...
