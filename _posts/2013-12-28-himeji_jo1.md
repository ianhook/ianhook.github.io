I just received the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metal-Earth-Laser-Cut-Model/dp/B00D0XPVYY" target="blog2">Himeji-jou Metal Earth model</a> from a friend as a Christmas present.  When I received it I was told that some of the reviews said that this model was very difficult, has confusing directions and could take up to 13 hours to complete.  The Amazon description says "Easy to assemble, takes 1-2 hours".  Reviews on Amazon are more mixed: "The metal bends very easily and care must be taken to properly shape those pieces that require shaping. The right tools are essential. You will need fine needle nose pliers, tweezers, straight edges for bending, a shear cutter to remove the pieces from the metal sheet and a good magnifying lamp. The effort will be worth it." and "It took me about 3-5 hours to finish. All of the Metal Earth puzzles are technique sensitive. I wouldn't recommend this model if this is your first Metal Earth puzzle. Chances are, you will break a piece or two, since every pieces are so delicate. I highly recommend a plier or a tweezer."

We shall see.

Three sheets of metal each about 4.75" squares.

At this point I agree that the directions are the clearest, mostly because they've decided to make them as universal as possible and include a minimum of English.  This is also why I'm not sure how many pieces there are.  If duplicate pieces, if there are duplicates, are uniquely numbered then 56 is the max.  The pieces are located a bit randomly about the sheets so I'll have to be careful when I remove them and only remove what I have time to build.

One of the sheets is already a bit warped.  I'll leave them under a book tonight and hopefully that'll be fixed by the time I locate some pliers to work on this with.  Two reviews, the instruction manual, and common sense all say I need them, and perhaps something else to help me remove pieces from sheets.  

Challenge excepted.
